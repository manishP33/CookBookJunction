# Project2 - CooKBook Junction
This project is about a website where users can share each others recipes. A kind of food blogging too. It is built on Ruby on rails. Planning and making ERDs was easy part but had some difficulty in coding. So as I was progressing, made many changes to the project.
# User Story :

1.As a user, if i click on homepage button/cookbook icon/website logo, I should see the home page or index page.

2.As a user, clicking sign up, should give me authorization for as member-user.

3.Clicking on new recipe, gives me permission to create new recipe but as authorize user only.

4.As a authorize user, I should be able to edit, create and delete blogs/ recipes.

5.As a anonymous user, I should be able able see selected recipes and comment on them.

6.About button should give me info about the website.

# Unsolved problems:
* Working on setting proper authentication of users and admin.
